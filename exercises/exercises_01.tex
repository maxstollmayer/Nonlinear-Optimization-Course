\begin{problem}

Let \(X \subseteq \R^n\) be a nonempty convex set and \(f : \R^n \to \R\) a convex function. Show that every local minimum of \(f\) with respect to \(X\) is a global minimum of \(f\) with respect to \(X\).

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}

Let \(y^*\) be a global minimum and \(x^*\) be a local minimum. If \(f(x^*) = f(y^*)\) we are done, so suppose that \(f(y^*) < f(x^*)\).

Since \(f\) is convex we have for all \(\lambda \in [0, 1)\)

\begin{align*}
    f \big( \lambda x^* + (1-\lambda) y^* \big) &\le \lambda f(x^*) + (1-\lambda) f(y^*) \\
    &< \lambda f(x^*) + (1-\lambda) f(x^*) \\
    &= f(x^*).
\end{align*}

Since \(X\) is convex there exists a \(\lambda \in [0,1)\) such that \(\lambda x^* + (1-\lambda) y^*\) is inside a neighbourhood in which \(x^*\) is the local minimum.

But then \(f(x^*) \le f \big( \lambda x^* + (1-\lambda) y^* \big) < f(x^*)\), which is a contradiction. So \(f(x^*) = f(y^*)\) and thus \(x^*\) is also a global minimum.
